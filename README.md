# Thought-Leaders

### Why do we need thought leaders?

- We need more people who can persuade others to act, even if they are far beyond their personal circle.

- More people with the ability to engage people are needed to make a difference.

- More people are needed to spark movements that change laws and attitudes.


Thought leaders are often seen as having a competitive edge over others since they are more known than their colleagues and understand how to effect change. As thought leaders, we will engage those around us, who will then engage others in their circle, spreading our ideas far and wide. The reward of being a thought leader is that Thought leaders may develop influence in their sector or society over time, have a greater effect on themes and causes that are important to them, and typically leave a legacy that is important to them.


While it's easy to get caught up in the next problem that arises, thought leaders must look beyond tomorrow and consider what would encourage people to act on their own.

Thought leaders use the **premortem** process, which is when we think through what may happen in order to ensure that we're taking the necessary steps to prevent it from happening.
