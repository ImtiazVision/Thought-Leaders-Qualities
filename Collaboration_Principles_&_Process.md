### Collaboration Principles and Process

Collaboration: is defined as individuals working together to accomplish a common objective. Part of being effective is doing the maximum amount of work in the minimum amount of time. Selecting the appropriate individuals for the right role is critical, and we should only invite people after we know exactly what we want them to contribute to.

### First impression 

First impressions are seen as a shortcut to success. A first impression functions as a fulcrum and a lever. We can make a significant impact with a modest amount of dedicated effort. Mastering the first 20 seconds of any engagement impacts the next 20 minutes. Most people establish an impression of us in less than 20 seconds. We usually create our first impression of someone inside the first 20 seconds. This allows us to make eye contact and shake hands quickly.
