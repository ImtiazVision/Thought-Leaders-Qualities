### Collaboration Principles and Process

**Collaboration**: is defined as individuals working together to accomplish a common objective. The unified aim is crucial in this situation. We want to be efficient and effective. Part of being effective is doing the maximum amount of work in the minimum amount of time. Thus, selecting the appropriate individuals for the right role is critical, and we should only invite people to join our team after we know exactly what we want them to contribute to a certain project.
