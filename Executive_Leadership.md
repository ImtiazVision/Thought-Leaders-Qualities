### Executive Leadership

  - In order to create trust in our role as an executive, engage in activities that will make usÂ more trustworthy (someone who other people can rely on), credible (someone who provides value), and connected (build repertoire and relationship).

  - Effective executives make it a habit to think both forward in time and space, in contrast to the majority of individuals whose thoughts are preoccupied with the here and now.
  - According to the considerable study that Bob Sutton has conducted at Stanford, a good boss may increase employee happiness, which in turn leads to increased staff retention, performance, production, and profitability.
  - A research that was published not too long ago in the Harvard Business Review came to the conclusion that in order for a person to prosper as a C-level executive, they need to be an excellent communicator, a collaborator, and a strategic thinker.
