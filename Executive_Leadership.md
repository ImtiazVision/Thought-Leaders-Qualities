### Executive Leadership

  - In order to create trust in our role as an executive, engage in activities that will make usÂ more trustworthy (someone who other people can rely on), credible (someone who provides value), and connected (build repertoire and relationship).

  - Effective executives make it a habit to think both forward in time and space, in contrast to the majority of individuals whose thoughts are preoccupied with the here and now.
