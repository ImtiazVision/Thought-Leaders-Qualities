### Five Advantages of Collaboration :

1. The first advantage is **diversity**. Putting together distinct and varied viewpoints, especially on a complicated subject, has been proved in research to result in more successful solutions. Because our group members will all be aware of the same possible solutions and impediments to success if they all come from the same background. It's superfluous. Bringing in other viewpoints enables for more creative brainstorming and "thinking outside the box." For example, a salesperson may inform the product team on what customers want and what they don't. This may enable the product team to remove a feature that was consuming a lot of time and effort in the first place.

2. The second advantage is speed. We'll discover that if the team is connected and responsible to the ultimate purpose, protocols for working together, and behavioral standards, the team will move quicker. This, however, requires a great deal of self-control.

3. Engagement is the third benefit. According to research, effective teamwork leads to better employee engagement. Employees that are engaged care more about their job and put more effort into it.

4. This brings us to the fourth benefit, increased productivity. We are more likely to be productive if we have strong trust, clarity on our goals, methods, and standards, and everyone feels involved. 

5. Finally, benefit number five: increased empathy. To achieve increased productivity and higher production while relying on diversity of thinking, we must first really comprehend one other's points of view. Collaboration helps individuals develop empathy for their colleagues, which has a cascading effect since those team members would interact with non-team members with greater empathy after developing the muscle with their collaborative team.
