### Logic Map

By decomposing complex problems into smaller, bit-sized components using logic maps, it is possible to identify the underlying root cause of a given problem. After constructing a logic map and identifying all the issues that may be contributing to our top-level problem, we must move toward potential solutions.

### Pareto Principle

Once we've generated an initial set of solutions for a given problem, we must prioritize our efforts because time and resources are limited, and we must focus our problem-solving efforts on the highest-value opportunities. And to do so, we should follow the 80/20 rule, also known as the **Pareto principle**, which states that we should spend 80% of our time on the 20% of issues that drive the answer. To put it another way, we want to focus our efforts on using the least amount of energy possible to achieve the greatest impact.
