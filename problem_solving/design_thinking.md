### Design Thinking : 

**Design Thinking** : is a user-centered process for addressing business challenges, designing products, and creating experiences. The user or consumer is given the biggest significance in this way of problem-solving when attempting to solve the problem and come up with a solution. Design thinking is the process of putting ourselves in the shoes of the user and understanding their wants in order to create a solution that meets their demands.

### Five Steps in Design Thinking : 

The five stages are:

- **Empathizing with the user (human empathy)** : Human Empathy is the first and most important step of Design Thinking. The problem is perceived through the eyes of the users at this stage, and a solution is generated based on an empathic understanding of the users' needs. While developing a solution, this technique helps the designer and team to set aside their opinions and assumptions.
