# Six-Decision-Making-Biases

People prefer information and perspectives that reinforce their pre-existing beliefs.

## Hindsight Bias

**Hindsight bias** is the predisposition to believe that previous events were predicted

**Avoiding Hindsight Bias** :

 - Recognize that the future is unpredictable.
 - Make use of current data.
 - Create a plan of action.

## Base Rate Bias 

The underlying probability that is unaffected by prior occurrences is referred to as the **base rate bias**.Ignoring the base rate will lead to the incorrect conclusion. For example, Three out of every four automobile accidents occur within 25 miles of our house; nevertheless, considering that 90 percent of driving happens near to home, it is undoubtedly safer to travel closer to home than away from home.

## Confirmation Bias

**Confirmation bias** refers to the propensity for individuals to seek out information that confirms our prior beliefs while ignoring information that contradicts them. We overestimate the good news and underestimate the negative. In certain circumstances, we seek information to support a conclusion we've already made.

## Availability Bias 

**Availability bias**: When individuals think about how easy it is to come up with examples of what occurs, they use the availability heuristic to help them. If we can think of anything, we should assume it is essential. To put it another way, availability is a measure of how easy it is to visualize something. It also has an impact on us in other ways. The more the ease with which we can envisage the ramifications, the larger our expectations are that they will be. Things that are vivid, striking, or emotionally overwhelming are more likely to be remembered. Even worse, we have a tendency to pay more attention to some memories than others, which results in poor decision-making.

## Overconfidence Bias

**Overconfidence bias**: is a false conviction in one's own innate reasoning that is not supported by evidence. We consider ourselves to be significantly more capable decision-makers than we really are. According to studies, people tend to overestimate our capacity to anticipate and the clarity of information we have about a certain situation or scenario. The capacity of people to assess probability is not well calibrated. We have a propensity to exaggerate the chances of something occurring in our lives. That is a sign of arrogance. Overconfidence may result from a number of different factors. One is that we oversimplify things much too often. Situations at work are frequently far more complicated than you believe. Another factor is that we don't take into account the influence of chance in our decisions. Every decision entails some degree of uncertainty. We mistakenly believe that luck will always be on our side, especially after a streak of triumphs, so we take excessive chances and roll the dice once more. Expertise is another major driver of overconfidence. If we are experts in a certain field, that sense of competence pervades other aspects of our lives. In summary, we believe we are wiser and have more information than we do.

## Sunk Cost Bias 

**A sunk cost**: is a resource, like as money, time, or people, that has already been squandered in an endeavour that cannot be recovered. It's gone, and there's no way to recover it. The sunk cost fallacy occurs when people make decisions about a current situation based on what they've already invested in it, such as continuing to pour resources into a failed project in the hopes of saving it or because we believe the wasted cost would otherwise be squandered. The truth is that we do this all the time without even realizing it.
