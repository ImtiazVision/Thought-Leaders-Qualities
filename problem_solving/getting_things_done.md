### Getting Things Done 

1. **Capture**: The first step is to collect and identify everything that is not on cruise control, may be out of place, or is not precisely where it should be. 
2. **Clarify**: Then we make decisions regarding what we've captured i.e. we emphasize their significance to us.
3. **Organize**: After we've captured and clarified our thoughts, we need to organize them. In other words, we need to put these things where they go so we don't have to keep pondering them or having them annoy or distract us from what we're doing.
4. **Reflect** : In this phase, we take a step back and review and reflect on what it all means, while also draw the big picture.
5. **Engage**
