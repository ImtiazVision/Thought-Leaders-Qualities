### Getting Things Done 

1. **Capture**: The first step is to collect and identify everything that is not on cruise control, may be out of place, or is not precisely where it should be. Then we make decisions regarding what we've captured i.e. we emphasize their significance to us.
2. **Clarify**
3. **Organize**
4. **Reflect**
5. **Engage**
