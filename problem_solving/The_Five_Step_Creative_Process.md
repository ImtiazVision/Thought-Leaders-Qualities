### The Five Step Creative Process

BBDO co-founder Alex Osborn and Creative Education Foundation president Sidney Parnes were the first to outline the whole creative process. These five steps of the creative process are as follows:

1. **Objective finding**: A goal is a state of mind that leads to a solution. Finding our aims entails asking ourselves questions such as "What is our goal?" and "What will fixing this challenge finally accomplish?" Maintain our attention on the ideal condition we wish to achieve, rather than merely the solution to the issue. Begin by answering the following question about our issue: "Wouldn't it be amazing if...?" This is an ambitious statement, forcing us to visualize the conclusion of our solution.
2. **Data gathering**: The hunt for insight begins with data collecting and concludes with the decision of whether data is crucial, intriguing, and insightful.
3. **Problem design**: Determine whether the initial problem is still the proper one to tackle after setting objectives and obtaining data.
4. **Ideation**: Don't solve the problem during ideation; instead, develop as many options as we can and leave judging those ideas to the following step.
5. **Selection**: Be very clear about what a solution to our problem includes, and be ruthless in deciding whether proposals meet those requirements.
