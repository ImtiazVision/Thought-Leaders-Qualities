### Emotional Intelligence :

**Emotional Intelligence** : Daniel Goleman, a specialist in emotional intelligence, identifies five pillars of emotional intelligence:

  1. **Self Awareness**: is the understanding of who we are, our strengths and shortcomings, our ideas, beliefs, values, actions, and emotions, amongst other things.
  2. **Self Regulation**: The capacity to regulate our emotions, handle disruptive or unpleasant thoughts, and reflect before acting is referred to as self regulation.
  3. **Motivation**: is defined as a strong desire to achieve, a propensity to remain optimistic in the face of defeat, and a readiness to learn. It is the capacity to be motivated by more than just intrinsic motivators and to demonstrate true energy and tenacity that will secure success.
  4. **Empathy**: is the capacity to comprehend another person's emotional composition and to treat them in the way they desire to be treated.
  5. **Social Skills**: are the capacity to create and manage relationships, to identify common ground, to develop rapport, and to demonstrate that we actually care about other people rather than for social advantage.
