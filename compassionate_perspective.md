### Compassion

**Compassion** is defined as a genuine care for the well-being of others. It's not about being a softie or a pushover; it's about seeing beyond ourselves, experiencing what they're feeling, and wanting to do something about it.

  > Compassion = Empathy + Action

It's about knowing that our group members, whether we agree with them or not, are people with a history, perspectives, and legitimate reasons for those perspectives. Collaboration is elevated by compassion beyond concept comparison and respectful compromise. The compassionate perspective helps us to comprehend, as best we can, how the other person came to have that concept or emotion, and why she or he is holding onto it.
